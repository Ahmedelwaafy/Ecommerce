## API Creating

I've Created the API with JSON Server and Hosted Online on Render>com with Aid of node.js.

Steps:

1-Create new repo then clone it in vs-code in a new folder.

2-Install the package.json file.

```sh
npm init -y
```
3-Open the package.json file and add this script.

```sh
"start" : "node index.js"
```
4-Install json server.

```sh
npm install json-server cors
```

```sh
npm install json-serve
```

5-Create a .gitignore file and add the node-modules file to it.

6-Create the index.js and db.json files.

7-Add a certain logic to the index.js file, you can get this logic from  [here](https://github.com/Ahmedelwaafy/Nike-API).

8-Add your JSON data to the dp.json file.

9-Add, commit and push the changes.

10-Go to the render website and connect with your GitHub account then create new web services then choose your repo then click create a web service.

> Other web hosting services will work like Vercel, Netlify, Railway...etc.
